# Ashley Arthur - Curriculum Vitae

E: ashleyarthur30@yahoo.co.uk

Experienced QA Engineer, passionate technologist and aspiring developer looking for new challenges
to prove that quality and development doesn't need to be separate concerns.

Having tested applications and developed tools using python, I’ve seen the positives and problems a dynamic runtime can bring and found myself enthused by the direction Apple is taking with Swift, a modern language with a strong emphasis on compile time guarantees. I think it's an exciting time to be working with the iOS technology stack and I'm keen to be a part of the professional community.

In my free time I enjoy creating new app ideas and when away from the computer (gasp!) you'll find me learning mandarin or travelling places with a camera in hand.

## Skills 

### iOS development 

Swift first developer with exposure to objective C and it's bridging and interop features. I'm knowledgable in key Apple frameworks:

- Responsive and maintainable viewcontrollers with UIkit and Autolayout
- Efficient networking and appropriate error handling using NSURLSession
- Simple, sane and performant Core data setups for persistence.

### Python

Strong understanding of python, I use it regularly for tools and automated testing:

- Commandline tools that use 3rd party REST api's to help save time and reduce error.
- Writing automated testing infrastructure for data validation and subprocess management 
- Reliable automated testing - the best test is one that fails correctly

### Software Testing

Thorough and conscientious, I find defects and manage their life cycle to mitigate impact on the end user experience.

- Functional and system level test plans to provide key insights into build stability.
- Maintainable tests written with the agile process in mind.


### Other Skills 
- Cross Platform: Windows, OSX, iOS, Linux 
- Front end web technologies: HTML, JS, CSS and preprocessors 
- Source control and CI platforms: GIT, Perforce, Jenkins 
- Ticket tracking systems Jira, Target Process 
- 3D content production: Autodesk suite, Adobe CS, Foundry Tools

## Open Source / Projects

* ### HueInspired
  A application that helps artists discover inspiration from their photo collection. It picks a series of dominant colors from a photo to form a color palette. Users can see the currently trending photos on Flickr transformed as palettes as well as their own photo collection. It uses NSURLSession to retrieve network data, Core Data as its persistence layer and a table view with custom cells to display it all.

* ### TPAPI
  Generate automatic python bindings for the 3rd party target process rest api. The service exposes an endpoint for data model metadata which enabled me to generate at runtime classes that simplified data retrieval as well as object graph traversal. I really came to appreciate the descriptor protocol and the ability to create custom object properties for transparent api design.
